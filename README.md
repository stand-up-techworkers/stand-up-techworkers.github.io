# About

Stand Up Techworkers is a simple resource to help tech workers share information
about the political and ethical decisions made for the companies we work for.  
It's important for us to know what our labor is supporting.

If you want to get involved, there are four main things you can do to help:

* Research information on various companies
* Add information about various tech conferences at the site
* Create flyers for people to hand out at tech conferences, including:
    * Company-specific flyers
    * Event-specific flyers, providing information specifically about the companies
    at the event
* Go to conferences (either attending, or just for this purpose) and pass the flyers out
